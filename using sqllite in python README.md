This project builds a Sales Analytics Dashboard using SQLite, Pandas, and Matplotlib.  
It generates 1000 random sales records across multiple products, stores them in a database, and produces clear visualizations for revenue, sales quantity, and average pricing.  
The dashboard provides insights into total sales performance, top-selling products, revenue distribution, and pricing trends â€” making it a beginner-friendly project for learning SQL, data analysis, and visualization in Python.
