📊 Sales Dashboard – Power BI
📌 Objective

The objective of this project is to design a professional and interactive business dashboard using Power BI that enables stakeholders to analyze sales and profit performance across regions, categories, and customer segments. The dashboard emphasizes clarity, interactivity, and storytelling with data.

Sales

Profit

📈 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The dashboard provides the following key insights:

Sum of Sales by Category

Sum of Sales by Segment

Sum of Profit by Region
